# DDLC-3DS
A Doki Doki Literature Club port for the 3DS! Programmed in Lua, running under the LovePotion framework.

This port is unofficial and is not affiliated with Team Salvato. Please support the official game. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: http://ddlc.moe

This was intended to be only for 3DS systems, but it is now also working on other platforms that support LÖVE or LovePotion. It will still have 2 screens, though.

**Locations of save files:**

| Platform | Location                       |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| 3DS      | /3ds/data/LovePotion/DDLC-3DS/ |
| Switch   | /switch/DDLC-3DS/              |
| Windows  | %appdata%\LOVE\DDLC-3DS\       |

You can reset the save data and start over by deleting all of the files on that folder.

New 3DS/2DS users should disable L2 Cache before playing this.

### Building (3DS):
You cannot build DDLC-3DS on your own. you have to add it to LovePotion 1.0.9, replace the makefile and meta files, and compile it with the game folder.
